# SudokuSolver
Program to automatically solve sudoku puzzles given 9x9 int array using recursion and backtracking.



8/16/2022: This was my first program I "uploaded" to GitHub. I did not know how to use GitHub back then, hence why the code is copy-pasted into a markdown file. The code should all work fine copy and pasted though.
