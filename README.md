# SudokuSolver
A Java class that holds a 9x9 grid of integers 0-9 representing a Sudoku puzzle (0 represents an unsolved space). The class has an internal algorithm to automatically "solve" objects of the class according to standard sudoku rules. The algorithm is a brute-force one using recursion and backtracking.

This was my first program I "uploaded" to GitHub. I did not know how to use GitHub back then, hence why the code is copy-pasted into a markdown file. The code should all work fine copy and pasted though.
